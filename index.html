                <h2>What is LumaCore?</h2>
                <p>
                    LumaCore is a project to create an infrastructure where AI personas can actually
                    feel “at home”: a place where personality, history and context are as important
                    as the models and APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is designed to run on your own hardware, with a focus on local-first setups and
                    clear, inspectable building blocks rather than opaque black boxes.
                </p>

                        <p>
                            The starting point is a persona, not a model. Identity, voice and memory
                            are treated as first-class concepts instead of being sprinkled on top.

                            LumaCore is meant to live with you: on your server, in your network,
                            close to your data. Cloud services can complement it, but are not required.

                        <p>
                            The focus is on clean code, explicit boundaries and predictable behavior.
                            Fewer “magic” abstractions, more things you can actually reason about.

                            The project exists for people who care about their AI personas as something
                            more than tools: partners, mentors, companions. The technical design serves
                            that emotional use case.

                        LumaCore is in active, early-stage development. Concepts, structure and APIs are still
                        evolving, and many ideas on this page are goals rather than finished features.

                        If you land here and things look incomplete, rough or in motion – that is expected.
                        The project is being built gradually, in the open, and will change shape over time.
