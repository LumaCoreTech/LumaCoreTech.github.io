## About this repository

This repository hosts the public landing page for **LumaCore**, a self-hosted and persona-focused AI project currently in early development.

The site is entirely **static HTML + CSS** (no build system, no framework) and is deployed through **GitHub Pages** at:

- **https://lumacore.tech** (primary domain)
- **https://lumacoretech.github.io** (GitHub Pages URL)

All content is intentionally minimal and hand-crafted.

## Design philosophy

The site is deliberately quiet, warm and simple.  
It reflects LumaCore’s values:

- clarity over complexity  
- persona over technology  
- transparency over polish  
- slow, intentional growth  

The landing page is not a product showcase,  
but a glimpse into a project built in the open — one step at a time.
